Description: Provides routines to check identifiability or non-identifiability
    of linear structural equation models as described in Drton, Foygel, and
    Sullivant (2011) <DOI:10.1214/10-AOS859>, Foygel, Draisma, and Drton (2012) 
    <DOI:10.1214/12-AOS1012>, and other works. The routines are based on the graphical 
    representation of structural equation models by a path diagram/mixed graph.
