Title: Identifiability of linear structural equation models
Author: Rina Foygel <rina@uchicago.edu>, Mathias Drton <md5@uw.edu>, Luca Weihs <lucaw@uw.edu>.
Maintainer: Mathias Drton <md5@uw.edu>
Depends: R (>= 2.10.1), igraph
Description: This package provides routines to check identifiability or
  non-identifiability of linear structural equation models as described in
  Drton, Foygel & Sullivant (Ann. Statist., 2011) and Foygel, Draisma & Drton
  (Ann. Statist., 2012).  The routines are based on the graphical representation
  of structural equation models by a path diagram/mixed graph.
