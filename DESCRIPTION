Description: Provides routines to check identifiability or non-identifiability
    of linear structural equation models as described in Drton, Foygel &
    Sullivant (Ann. Statist., 2011) and Foygel, Draisma & Drton (Ann. Statist.,
    2012). The routines are based on the graphical representation of
    structural equation models by a path diagram/mixed graph.
